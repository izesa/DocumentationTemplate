# 4. Activity of Day 4: Materials and Fabrication Methodes

## 1. Understanding Materials through Making
For Day 4 Activity, we were supposed to understand the intersection of Materials and fabrication methods. this is where the actions meets it's place of work or field. As learners we have to understand the materials components and the exact methods to use on that particular objects.
## 2. Why is this important?

Materials are not just components; they are the foundation of what we
create. They dictate durability, functionality, and even sustainability. The choices made here ripple through the entire product lifecycle.
1. They describe the durability of the designed object.
2. have a clear understanding of how the formation and cost efficiency must match.

## 3. Material Properties & Selection
Material selection also is one of the key aspect of modeling and fabrication techniques which reduces the cost failure occurs in the designing process.

1. Key Material Properties
• Strength & Flexibility
• Density
• Thermal & Electrical Behavior

2. Selection Depends On
• Intended Function
• Fabrication Method
• Environment of Use

3. Strategic Approach
Choose materials based on performance requirements, not just aesthetic
appeal.

## 4. Conclusion
Materials and Fabrication Methods Aspect aims to understand first of all the material to be used for example like the texture of a PCB board materials before drilling and designing circuit onit, to understand what makes materials that are used for 3D printing, how thickness and reliable they are. All these information gathered together for facilitating the Fabrication process of the those materials.
