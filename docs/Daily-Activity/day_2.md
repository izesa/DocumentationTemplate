# 2. Activity of Day 2: Digital modeling for Fabrication

## Summary
## 1. Introduction
 a digital model is a visual representation of a designed and printed object.  it's also  a set of instructions for machines.
 this reduces the issues of fabrication cost failures due to the modeling production in mind.

 ## 2. Precision Modeling and Scale Control
Precision modeling scale Control means Accurate Dimensions, Parametric Constrains and Real-World scale.
Tools like "FreeCAD" empower designers with exact measurements, constraint-based sketches,
and editable parameters, translating conceptual designs into tangible realities with unwavering
accuracy

## 3. 3D Modeling for Fabrication (FreeCAD Example)
 Key Practices:
• Fully constrained sketches prevent unintended changes.

• Parametric dimensions allow for easy design modifications.

• Exclusive use of solid modeling ensures physical integrity.

 A visually correct model may still be fabrication-incorrect.
Focus on structural integrity and machine readability, not just aesthetic
appeal, to guarantee successful physical output.

## Activity 1: Designing L-shaped wall hook (3D) using FreeCad application.
the activity is to design the model for being able to print it. using FreeCad app, the selected model is first designed in 2 dimension and then the resulted shape is modified with in 3D space.
