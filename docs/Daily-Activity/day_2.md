# 2. Activity of Day 2: Digital modeling for Fabrication

## Summary
## 1. Introduction
 a digital model is a visual representation of a designed and printed object.  it's also  a set of instructions for machines.
 this reduces the issues of fabrication cost failures due to the modeling production in mind.

 ## 2. Precision Modeling and Scale Control
Precision modeling scale Control means Accurate Dimensions, Parametric Constrains and Real-World scale.
Tools like "FreeCAD" empower designers with exact measurements, constraint-based sketches,
and editable parameters, translating conceptual designs into tangible realities with unwavering
accuracy

## 3. 3D Modeling for Fabrication (FreeCAD Example)
 Key Practices:
• Fully constrained sketches prevent unintended changes.

• Parametric dimensions allow for easy design modifications.

• Exclusive use of solid modeling ensures physical integrity.

 A visually correct model may still be fabrication-incorrect.
Focus on structural integrity and machine readability, not just aesthetic
appeal, to guarantee successful physical output.

## Activity 1: Designing L-shaped wall hook (3D) using FreeCad application.
the activity is to design the model for being able to print it. using FreeCad app, the selected model is first designed in 2 dimension and then the resulted shape is modified with in 3D space.
The following image shows the picture of the L-Shaped Mounting Bracket model designed using FreeCAD application.

## Activity 2: Press-Fit Box Panel (2D Vector) model design
As learners we are required to recognize the A flat rectangular panel, Rectangular slots cut into the edges, Slots sized to match material thickness and also the Entirely 2D vector geometry. these all task must be completed in Inkscape software which very suitable to this manuals.
